We are a group of aspiring young Chinese physicists in the greater Boston area, including undergraduates, graduate students and post-docs from Boston College, Boston University, Brandeis, Harvard, MIT, Northeastern and Tufts. We gather for seminar and other fun activities frequently to talk about physics, learn from each other, create ideas and sparkles, or to just enjoy a game of Werewolf.
